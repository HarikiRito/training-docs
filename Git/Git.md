## Git

Git is an essential tool for working in a team environment, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on the same codebase efficiently. 

### Basic Git Commands
- **Checkout**: Switch between branches using `git checkout <branch-name>`
- **Create Branch**: Create a new branch with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
- **Push**: Upload changes to remote repository with `git push origin <branch-name>`
- **Pull**: Fetch and integrate remote changes using `git pull`

### Merging and Resolving Conflicts
When conflicts occur during merging:
```bash
# Merge a branch
git merge <branch-name>

# After resolving conflicts, mark files as resolved
git add <file-name>
git commit
```

### Best Practices for Commits
- Commit small, logical groups of changes
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages
- Example of a good commit message:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Fix bug in user authentication flow"
  ```

### Creating Pull Requests (PR)
1. Push your branch to the remote repository
2. Go to GitHub/GitLab repository
3. Click "Compare & pull request"
4. Add description and assign reviewers  
5. Create pull request

### Best Practices for Pull Requests
- **Descriptive Title**: Use a clear and concise title that summarizes the changes.
- **Detailed Description**: Explain what changes were made, why they were made, and any relevant context. This helps reviewers understand the purpose of the PR.
- **Link Issues**: If applicable, link to any related issues or tasks in your project management tool.
- **Request Specific Feedback**: If there are particular areas you want feedback on, mention them in the description.
- **Keep PRs Small**: Aim for smaller, focused pull requests to make them easier to review.

### After Creating a Pull Request
- **Monitor Feedback**: Keep an eye on comments and suggestions from reviewers. Be responsive and open to making changes.
- **Make Revisions**: If changes are requested, make the necessary updates and push them to the same branch. The pull request will automatically update.
- **Merge When Ready**: Once all feedback has been addressed and approvals are received, merge the pull request into the main branch.
- **Delete the Branch**: After merging, consider deleting the feature branch to keep the repository clean.

### Importance of Pull Requests
Pull requests are crucial for maintaining code quality and facilitating collaboration. They allow team members to review each other's work, catch potential issues early, and ensure that the codebase remains stable and maintainable.
