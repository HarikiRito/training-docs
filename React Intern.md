# React Intern Level

Congratulations on your first day of React Internship! In order to get started, you must know the basics of React. The following concepts should be familiar to you:

- [React Components](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) - Learn how to create and use components
- [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) - Understand the syntax extension for JavaScript
- [State](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory) - Manage component's internal data that can change over time
- [Props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) - Pass data from parent to child components
- [Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/react-hooks) - Use state and other React features in functional components

## TypeScript

Although you can use React without TypeScript, TypeScript is a must for this internship. Why, you ask? Almost all of the enterprise projects use TypeScript to build their applications. When you working as a team, the JavaScript codebase often falls apart really quick as the time goes by. This is due to the nature that JavaScript is a dynamic language, and you can only find out the error when you run the code. 

With TypeScript, it is a different story. TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that you can find out the error before you run the code using the compiler. Although it takes time to learn from the start to understand the concept, it is crucial for any good codebase that reduce the cost of maintenance significantly.

For you to pass this level, you must be able to understand the following concepts:

- [Basic Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html) - Understand the fundamental data types in TypeScript, including `boolean`, `number`, `string`, and more.
- [Interfaces and Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html) - Learn how to define contracts within your code using interfaces, which describe the shape of objects.
