# React Training Material

Welcome to the React Training Material repository! This document serves as a comprehensive guide for learning React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Introduction to React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.

## Core Concepts

- **Components**: The building blocks of a React application.
- **JSX**: A syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript.
- **State and Props**: Mechanisms for managing data in your components.

## Advanced Topics

- **Hooks**: Functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
